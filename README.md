# Lecture Notes

This repository contains lecture notes and study material for various classes that I have taken.
I type up these notes as a means of learning the material and figuring out where I have gaps in my understanding of the course content. These notes are not TeX'ed up directly during the lecture, but are rather reconstructed from much more abbreviated notes that I jot down while I'm seeing the material for the first time.

These notes are not official, and haven't been proofread by the instructor for each course. As such, they're liable to contain errors or typos. If you find such an error, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could open a pull request to fix the issue (if you are proficient in LaTeX) or open an issue (so that I can fix it).

If you like the formatting of the notes, you are free to use my `notes` class from my [`coursework-latex`](https://github.com/jopetty/coursework-latex) repository.

\epigraph{``You are welcome to sit adoringly at my feet if you so wish.''}{Shelly}

Shelly (he asked us to call him that) talked about how there really isn't a good definition of what Philosophy is, perhaps unlike many other academic disciplines. Rather, it is defined by the types of things we ask questions about and the types of thoughts we study. Perhaps it's a ``Roller-coaster for your mind.''

\begin{definition}[Ethics]
Moral Philosophy or Ethics is the attempt to answer the question ``How should I live?'' In the course of answering this, various other questions will arise and must be answered along the way.
\end{definition}

This doesn't deal with the empirics of ``How \emph{do} we live.'' That is a realm for sociologists. We're also not really interested in people's opinions on justified actions --- we're concerned with what the truth of the matter actually is. There will be no ``comparative ethics'' here. We're also not doing a history of philosophical ideas here.

Philosophy thrives on rival views, not on proven results. There isn't a philosophical answer to ``what is well being?'' --- you have to decide for youself how to answer that question.
